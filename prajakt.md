# Introduction — Learner in the Upgrade Centre

I am a learner enrolled in the Upgrade Centre, focused on systematically improving my skills, tools, and workflows. My aim is to move from current practices to a more efficient, modern toolkit and mindset so I can produce higher-quality work faster.

## Background
- Comfortable with core concepts and everyday workflows.
- Ready to adopt newer practices, tools, and automation to cut manual effort.

## Goals

- Learn and apply one significant tool or practice each month.
- Raise code quality, testing, and documentation standards.
- Automate repetitive parts of the development lifecycle.
## Focus Areas

- Version control workflows and branching strategies
- Automated testing and CI/CD fundamentals
- Modern editor/IDE capabilities and extensions
- Documentation, markdown conventions, and knowledge sharing

## Plan

1. Identify current gaps and prioritize a single focus area.
2. Follow a compact learning sequence (tutorial → hands-on mini-project → review).
3. Introduce incremental improvements into real work.
4. Conduct short weekly reviews and adjust the plan as needed.

## Success Criteria

- At least one automated pipeline or tested feature integrated into a project.
- Measurable reduction in manual steps for repetitive tasks.
- Up-to-date, clear documentation for at least one repository.

## Next Steps

- Pick the first focus area and a concise project or tutorial.
- Block short, regular learning sessions and schedule a weekly review.
